Every person has a name. Most persons also have friends. Let's model that.

Let's assume that when person A considers person B a friend, person B also considers person A a friend (naive, I know).
 
We want two functions from this exercise:
 
(1) makeFriends() which takes two persons, and makes them friends with each other
(2) listFriends() which takes a person, and lists the names of their friends

P.S. We're being deliberately vague about types and function signatures here.
